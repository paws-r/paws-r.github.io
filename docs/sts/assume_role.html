access Amazon Web Services resources that you might not normally have
access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a
secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use
assume_role within your account or for
cross-account access. For a comparison of
assume_role with other API operations that produce
temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
and Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations
in the IAM User Guide.
Permissions
The temporary security credentials created by
assume_role can be used to make API calls to any
Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot
call the Amazon Web Services STS
get_federation_token or
get_session_token API operations.
(Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies
to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both
inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to
access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
information, see Session Policies
in the IAM User Guide.
When you create a role, you create two policies: A role trust policy
that specifies who can assume the role and a permissions policy that
specifies what can be done with the role. You specify the trusted
principal who is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.
To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services
account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined
in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy
states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in
the account.
A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The
administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
assume_role for the ARN of the role in the other
account.
To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either
of the following:
Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call
assume_role (as long as the role's trust policy
trusts the account).
Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.


You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM
resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a
principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is
required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based
policies, see IAM Policies
in the IAM User Guide.
Tags
(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags
are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
Passing Session Tags in STS
in the IAM User Guide.
An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control
in the IAM User Guide.
You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
during role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags
in the IAM User Guide.
Using MFA with AssumeRole
(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
when you call assume_role. This is useful for
cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role
has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that
scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a
condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not
include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied.
The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might
look like the following example.
&quot;Condition&quot;: {&quot;Bool&quot;: {&quot;aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent&quot;: true}}
For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access
in the IAM User Guide guide.
To use MFA with assume_role, you pass values for
the SerialNumber and TokenCode parameters. The SerialNumber value
identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The TokenCode is
the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces."><!-- mathjax --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js" integrity="sha256-nvJJv9wWKEm88qvoQl9ekL2J+k/RWIsaSScxxlsrv8k=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/config/TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML.js" integrity="sha256-84DKXVJXs0/F8OTMzX4UR909+jtl4G7SPypPavF+GfA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!--[if lt IE 9]>

    <dl><dt>RoleArn</dt>
<dd><p>[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.</p></dd>


<dt>RoleSessionName</dt>
<dd><p>[required] An identifier for the assumed role session.</p>
<p>Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be
logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also
used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security

<p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@-</p></dd>


<dt>PolicyArns</dt>
<dd><p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the
same account as the role.</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy
ARNs. However, the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed
session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information
about ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html" class="external-link">Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces</a>
in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.</p>
<p>An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by
percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
upper size limit.</p>
<p>Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to
access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session" class="external-link">Session Policies</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p></dd>


<dt>Policy</dt>
<dd><p>An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
policy.</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns
new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the
intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent
Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that
owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions
than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is

in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies
can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
character list (\codeU+0020 through \verbU+00FF). It can also include the tab
(\codeU+0009), linefeed (\verbU+000A), and carriage return (\verbU+000D) characters.</p>
<p>An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by
percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
upper size limit.</p></dd>


<dt>DurationSeconds</dt>
<dd><p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can
range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value
from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting
or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails.
For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
operation fails.</p>
<p>Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services
API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the
<code>assume_role</code> API operation to assume a role, you can
specify the duration of your role session with the <code>DurationSeconds</code>
parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12
hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role.
However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a
<code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter value greater than one hour, the operation
fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session" class="external-link">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>By default, the value is set to <code>3600</code> seconds.</p>
<p>The <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter is separate from the duration of a
console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes
a <code>SessionDuration</code> parameter that specifies the maximum length of the
console session. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html" class="external-link">Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the Amazon Web Services Management Console</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p></dd>


<dt>Tags</dt>
<dd><p>A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists
of a key name and an associated value. For more information about
session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html" class="external-link">Tagging Amazon Web Services STS Sessions</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the values
can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length" class="external-link">IAM and STS Character Limits</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by
percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
upper size limit.</p>
<p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already
attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with
the same key.</p>
<p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag
keys. Assume that the role has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you
pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and
<code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed
in the request takes precedence over the role tag.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this
operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the
calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an
inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a
session, see the CloudTrail logs. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_ctlogs" class="external-link">Viewing Session Tags in CloudTrail</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p></dd>


<dt>TransitiveTagKeys</dt>
<dd><p>A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If
you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes
to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining" class="external-link">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive, the
session policy and session tags packed binary limit is not affected.</p>
<p>If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are
passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.</p></dd>


<dt>ExternalId</dt>
<dd><p>A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in
another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role
belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the
<code>ExternalId</code> parameter. This value can be any string, such as a
passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to
trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the
trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the
trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role,
rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the
external ID, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html" class="external-link">How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your Amazon Web Services Resources to a Third Party</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@:/-</p></dd>


<dt>SerialNumber</dt>
<dd><p>The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
user who is making the <code>assume_role</code> call. Specify
this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a
condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the
serial number for a hardware device (such as <code>GAHT12345678</code>) or an
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as
<code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user</code>).</p>
<p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@-</p></dd>


<dt>TokenCode</dt>
<dd><p>The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role
being assumed requires MFA. (In other words, if the policy includes a
condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA
and if the <code>TokenCode</code> value is missing or expired, the
<code>assume_role</code> call returns an "access denied" error.</p>
<p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
sequence of six numeric digits.</p></dd>


<dt>SourceIdentity</dt>
<dd><p>The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the
<code>assume_role</code> operation.</p>
<p>You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume a
role. You do this by using the <code>sts:SourceIdentity</code> condition key in a
role trust policy. You can use source identity information in CloudTrail
logs to determine who took actions with a role. You can use the
