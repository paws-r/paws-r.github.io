A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate
network. You must call the
get_federation_token operation using the
long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is
appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored,
usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of
get_federation_token with the other API
operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
and Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations
in the IAM User Guide.
You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook,
Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case,
we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito or
assume_role_with_web_identity.
For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider
in the IAM User Guide.
You can also call get_federation_token
using the security credentials of an Amazon Web Services account root
user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create
an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a
policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions
and resources that they need to access. For more information, see IAM Best Practices
in the IAM User Guide.
Session duration
The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900
seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The
default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary
credentials obtained by using the Amazon Web Services account root user
credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
Permissions
You can use the temporary credentials created by
get_federation_token in any Amazon Web
Services service except the following:
You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web
Services API.
You cannot call any STS operations except
get_caller_identity.


You must pass an inline or managed session policy
to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both
inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a
policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.
When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the
intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you
pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more
permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the
IAM user. For more information, see Session Policies
in the IAM User Guide. For information about using
get_federation_token to create temporary
security credentials, see GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker.
You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a
resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the
federated user session in the Principal element of the policy, the
session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are
granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.
Tags
(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are
called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
Passing Session Tags in STS
in the IAM User Guide.
You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook,
Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case,
we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito or
assume_role_with_web_identity.
For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider
in the IAM User Guide.
An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control
in the IAM User Guide.
Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
means that you cannot have separate Department and department tag
keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the
Department=Marketing tag and you pass the department=engineering
session tag. Department and department are not saved as separate
tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over
the user tag."><!-- mathjax --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js" integrity="sha256-nvJJv9wWKEm88qvoQl9ekL2J+k/RWIsaSScxxlsrv8k=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/config/TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML.js" integrity="sha256-84DKXVJXs0/F8OTMzX4UR909+jtl4G7SPypPavF+GfA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!--[if lt IE 9]>
