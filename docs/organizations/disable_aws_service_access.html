that is specified by ServicePrincipal) with Organizations. When you
disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a
service-linked role
in new accounts in your organization. This means the service can't
perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your
organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts
until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.
We strongly recommend that you don't use this command to disable
integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon Web Services
service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the
specified service. This lets the trusted service perform any required
initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any
required resources and any required clean up of resources when disabling
trusted access.
For information about how to disable trusted service access to your
organization using the trusted service, see the Learn more link
under the Supports Trusted Access column at Amazon Web Services services that you can use with Organizations.
on this page.
If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following
actions to occur:
The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the
accounts in your organization. This means that the service can't
perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your
organization. The service can still perform operations in older
accounts until the service completes its clean-up from
Organizations.
The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts in
the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted
by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes
any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management
account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.
Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or
resources related to the integration, while other services stop
accessing the organization but leave any historical data and
configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the
integration.


Using the other service's console or commands to disable the integration
ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any
resources that are required only for the integration. How the service
cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that
service. For more information, see the documentation for the other
Amazon Web Services service.
After you perform the
disable_aws_service_access
operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in
your organization's accounts
For more information about integrating other services with
Organizations, including the list of services that work with
Organizations, see Integrating Organizations with Other Amazon Web Services Services
in the Organizations User Guide.
This operation can be called only from the organization's management
account."><!-- mathjax --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js" integrity="sha256-nvJJv9wWKEm88qvoQl9ekL2J+k/RWIsaSScxxlsrv8k=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/config/TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML.js" integrity="sha256-84DKXVJXs0/F8OTMzX4UR909+jtl4G7SPypPavF+GfA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!--[if lt IE 9]>
