authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity
provider. Example providers include the OAuth 2.0 providers Login with
Amazon and Facebook, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider
such as Google or Amazon Cognito federated identities.
For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You
can use Amazon Cognito with the Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide and the Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide to uniquely identify a user. You
can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the
lifetime of an application.
To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see Amazon Cognito Overview in
Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide and Amazon Cognito
Overview in the Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide.
Calling
assume_role_with_web_identity
does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials.
Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile
devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including
long-term Amazon Web Services credentials in the application. You also
don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term
Amazon Web Services credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is
validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a
comparison of
assume_role_with_web_identity
with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see
Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
and Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations
in the IAM User Guide.
The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an
access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications
can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to Amazon Web
Services service API operations.
Session Duration
By default, the temporary security credentials created by
assume_role_with_web_identity
last for one hour. However, you can use the optional DurationSeconds
parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a
value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role
in the IAM User Guide. The maximum session duration limit applies when
you use the AssumeRole* API operations or the assume-role* CLI
commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations
to create a console URL. For more information, see Using IAM Roles
in the IAM User Guide.
Permissions
The temporary security credentials created by
assume_role_with_web_identity can
be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the
following exception: you cannot call the STS
get_federation_token or
get_session_token API operations.
(Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies
to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both
inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to
access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
information, see Session Policies
in the IAM User Guide.
Tags
(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web
identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name
and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see
Passing Session Tags in STS
in the IAM User Guide.
You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can’t
exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For
these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits
in the IAM User Guide.
An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
other requirements. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by
percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
upper size limit.
You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached
to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with
the same key.
An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control
in the IAM User Guide.
You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
during role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags
in the IAM User Guide.
Identities
Before your application can call
assume_role_with_web_identity,
you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and
create a role that the application can assume. The role that your
application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated
with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be
specified in the role's trust policy.
Calling
assume_role_with_web_identity can
result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the
Subject
of the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using
any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For
example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as
suggested in the OIDC specification.

<dd><p>[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assuming.</p></dd>


<dt>RoleSessionName</dt>
<dd><p>[required] An identifier for the assumed role session. Typically, you pass the name
or identifier that is associated with the user who is using your
application. That way, the temporary security credentials that your
application will use are associated with that user. This session name is
included as part of the ARN and assumed role ID in the <code>AssumedRoleUser</code>

<dt>WebIdentityToken</dt>
<dd><p>[required] The OAuth 2.0 access token or OpenID Connect ID token that is provided
by the identity provider. Your application must get this token by
authenticating the user who is using your application with a web
identity provider before the application makes an
<code>assume_role_with_web_identity</code>
call.</p></dd>


<dt>ProviderId</dt>
<dd><p>The fully qualified host component of the domain name of the OAuth 2.0
identity provider. Do not specify this value for an OpenID Connect
identity provider.</p>
<p>Currently <code>www.amazon.com</code> and <code>graph.facebook.com</code> are the only
supported identity providers for OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Do not include
URL schemes and port numbers.</p>
<p>Do not specify this value for OpenID Connect ID tokens.</p></dd>


<dt>PolicyArns</dt>
<dd><p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the
same account as the role.</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy
ARNs. However, the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed
session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information
about ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html" class="external-link">Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces</a>

<dt>Policy</dt>
<dd><p>An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
policy.</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns
new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the
intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session

<p>The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies
can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
character list (\codeU+0020 through \verbU+00FF). It can also include the tab
(\codeU+0009), linefeed (\verbU+000A), and carriage return (\verbU+000D) characters.</p>

<dt>DurationSeconds</dt>
<dd><p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from
900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for
the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you
specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For
example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your

<p>By default, the value is set to <code>3600</code> seconds.</p>
<p>The <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter is separate from the duration of a
console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes
a <code>SessionDuration</code> parameter that specifies the maximum length of the
