This version of
the operation is performed by the account that wants to leave. To remove
a member account as a user in the management account, use
remove_account_from_organization
instead.
This operation can be called only from a member account in the
organization.
The management account in an organization with all features enabled
can set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what
administrators of member accounts can do. This includes preventing
them from successfully calling
leave_organization and leaving
the organization.
You can leave an organization as a member account only if the
account is configured with the information required to operate as a
standalone account. When you create an account in an organization
using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the
information required of standalone accounts is not automatically
collected. For each account that you want to make standalone, you
must perform the following steps. If any of the steps are already
completed for this account, that step doesn't appear.
Choose a support plan
Provide and verify the required contact information
Provide a current payment method


Amazon Web Services uses the payment method to charge for any
billable (not free tier) Amazon Web Services activity that occurs
while the account isn't attached to an organization. Follow the
steps at To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided
in the Organizations User Guide.
The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated
administrator account for any Amazon Web Services service enabled
for your organization. If the account is a delegated administrator,
you must first change the delegated administrator account to another
account that is remaining in the organization.
You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access
to billing in your account. For more information, see Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console
in the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were
attached to the account object in the organization are deleted.
Amazon Web Services accounts outside of an organization do not
support tags.
A newly created account has a waiting period before it can be
removed from its organization. If you get an error that indicates
that a wait period is required, then try again in a few days.
