You're authorized to create accounts in the Amazon Web Services
GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) Region, see the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.
You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
Region that is paired with a management account of an organization
in the commercial Region.
You call this action from the management account of your
organization in the commercial Region.
You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.


Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked role
named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see
Organizations and Service-Linked Roles
in the Organizations User Guide.
Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:
Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage.
For more information, see Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled
in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.


If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
organizations:TagResource permission. The tags are attached to the
commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the
GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the
tag_resource operation in the GovCloud
Region after the new GovCloud account exists.
You call this action from the management account of your organization in
the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account
in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is
created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For
more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see
Organizations
in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.
Calling
create_gov_cloud_account is
an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the
background. Because
create_gov_cloud_account
operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message
even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might
need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
Use the OperationId response element from this operation to
provide as a parameter to the
describe_create_account_status
operation.
Check the CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For
information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization
in the Organizations User Guide.


When you call the
create_gov_cloud_account
action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the
commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the
commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose
credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same
email address.
A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that
allows the management account in the organization in the commercial
Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is
then created and associated with the commercial account that you just
created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud
(US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud
(US) account that is associated with the management account of the
commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that
explains how account access works, see
Organizations
in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.
For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization
in the Organizations User Guide.
When you create an account in an organization using the
Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
required for the account to operate as a standalone account is not
automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing
the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account
from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide
the missing information. Follow the steps at To leave an organization as a member account
in the Organizations User Guide.
If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
account limits for the organization, contact Amazon Web Services
Support.
If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
then try again. If the error persists, contact Amazon Web Services
Support.
Using
create_gov_cloud_account
to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can
only close an account from the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost
Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For
information on the requirements and process for closing an account,
see Closing an Amazon Web Services account
in the Organizations User Guide.


When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to
Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for
the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access
billing information. For information about how to disable this switch
for an account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools."><!-- mathjax --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js" integrity="sha256-nvJJv9wWKEm88qvoQl9ekL2J+k/RWIsaSScxxlsrv8k=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/config/TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML.js" integrity="sha256-84DKXVJXs0/F8OTMzX4UR909+jtl4G7SPypPavF+GfA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!--[if lt IE 9]>

    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>Email</dt>
<dd><p>[required] Specifies the email address of the owner to assign to the new member
account in the commercial Region. This email address must not already be
associated with another Amazon Web Services account. You must use a
valid email address to complete account creation.</p>
<p>The rules for a valid email address:</p><ul><li><p>The address must be a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 64 characters
long.</p></li>
<li><p>All characters must be 7-bit ASCII characters.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be one and only one @ symbol, which separates the local
name from the domain name.</p></li>
<li><p>The local name can't contain any of the following characters:</p>
<p>whitespace, " ' ( ) \&lt; \&gt; [ ] : ; , \ | % &amp;</p></li>
<li><p>The local name can't begin with a dot (.)</p></li>
<li><p>The domain name can consist of only the characters
[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.)</p></li>
<li><p>The domain name can't begin or end with a hyphen (-) or dot (.)</p></li>
<li><p>The domain name must contain at least one dot</p></li>
</ul><p>You can't access the root user of the account or remove an account that
was created with an invalid email address. Like all request parameters
for
<code>create_gov_cloud_account</code>,
the request for the email address for the Amazon Web Services GovCloud
(US) account originates from the commercial Region, not from the Amazon
Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.</p></dd>


<dt>AccountName</dt>
<dd><p>[required] The friendly name of the member account.</p>
<p>The account name can consist of only the characters
[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.) You can't separate
characters with a dash (–).</p></dd>


<dt>RoleName</dt>
<dd><p>(Optional)</p>
<p>The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically preconfigures
in the new member accounts in both the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the management
account, allowing users in the management account to assume the role, as
permitted by the management account administrator. The role has
administrator permissions in the new member account.</p>
<p>If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to
<code>OrganizationAccountAccessRole</code>.</p>
<p>For more information about how to use this role to access the member
account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role" class="external-link">Accessing and Administering the Member Accounts in Your Organization</a>

in the <em>IAM User Guide.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex" class="external-link">regex pattern</a> that is used to
validate this parameter. The pattern can include uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and any of the following
characters: =,.@-</p></dd>


<dt>IamUserAccessToBilling</dt>
<dd><p>If set to <code>ALLOW</code>, the new linked account in the commercial Region
enables IAM users to access account billing information <em>if</em> they have
the required permissions. If set to <code>DENY</code>, only the root user of the
new account can access account billing information. For more
information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate" class="external-link">Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console</a>
in the <em>Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide.</em></p>
<p>If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to <code>ALLOW</code>, and
IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing
information for the new account.</p></dd>


<dt>Tags</dt>
<dd><p>A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account.
These tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the
GovCloud account, and not to the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to
the actual GovCloud account, call the
<code><a href="organizations_tag_resource.html">tag_resource</a></code> operation in the GovCloud
region after the new GovCloud account exists.</p>
<p>For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value.
You can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set it to
<code>null</code>. For more information about tagging, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tagging.html" class="external-link">Tagging Organizations resources</a>
in the Organizations User Guide.</p>
<p>If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the maximum allowed
number of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and the
account is not created.</p></dd>
